# Medical-Diagnostic-System-in-AI-using-Turbo-Prolog

It is an Artificially Intelligent Medical Diagnostic System which helps diagnose a disese based on patient's feedback
of symptoms felt by the patient. Save the code with a <file_name.PRO> extension. Instructions on how to run the file
in Turbo Prolog have been provided in the Instructions.doc file. You can change the names displayed in output by 
changing the code and saving it with <file_name.PRO> extension.
Objective of Mini Project : To design an intelligent diagnostic system that will be helpful for diagnosis of diseases based on their symptoms.
Scope of Mini Project     : An intelligent system which can diagnose the disease in a patient depending on his symptoms and suggest treatment. 
Technology to be used     : Turbo Prolog
